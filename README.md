# Face detection | OpenCV
This a personal project using Python and OpenCV. Using Haar cascades, we can detect faces either from a chosen image file or a webcam. A simple GUI is made using Tkinter.
## How to use :
You need to download all files and store them in the same folder in your working directory.
Make sure to install OpenCV in order to make use of this code.
You need to have a Python interpreter installed. You can run main.py on the command prompt.
A window will pop-up and you can choose either to look for a file from your computer or to capture an image from your webcam. If you go the webcam route, make sure to exit by pressing the escape key.
